Mutation 1: Create a Player

mutation {
  player (first_name:"echo", last_name:"last", team_id:1) {
    id
    first_name
    last_name
  }
}


Does this SQL

running on http://localhost:4000/api
INSERT INTO player (first_name, last_name, team_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?) RETURNING *
[ 'echo', 'last', 1 ]


Produces this result

{
  "data": {
    "player": {
      "id": null,
      "first_name": null,
      "last_name": null
    }
  }
}

Normally you can see the result of what you just added
But for this demo it's not working 100%, but that's okay for the demo


Do the List of Players Query to verify the new user shows in the list.
